version 0.2.? (April 15, 2013)
------------------------------

- added --debug flag to cli which will involk a traceback to be printed on errors 

- fixed bug with `clone` command (missing comma in a tuple of strings are not easy
to find.

- added better error trapping of HTTP errors thrown by requests. In particular, calls
to create an already existing repository were erroring with just a '400 ClientError: None'
message, which was not helpful. Now we parse the response content for info.

- fixed error with a throw-away try-catch. Thanks to Florian for the patch.

- updated README

- trimmed down the `update` command. Options for changing the scm and protocol don't do anything,
so stripped the options down just to changing the public/private.
